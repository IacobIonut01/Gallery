Improvements

- Faster media grid loading & smoother scrolling (downsampling, buffer reuse, single‑flight decrypt, adaptive thresholds)
- Reduced memory & GC pressure (temp spill for large decrypts, ByteArrayPool, sidecar metadata cache, decrypt LRU)
- Redesigned UI with large‑screen accessibility enhancements
- Reliable audio focus toggle (player rebuild logic)
- Deferred & safe original media deletion after successful vault operations
- Unified all‑workers progress screen
- Streamlined copy progress (ViewModel + Flow)
- Enhanced media info panel (richer technical metadata)
- More resilient vault operations (missing URIs skipped, portable vault migration fallback)
- Album screen layout toggle (GridView ⇆ ColumnView)
- Revamped VideoPlayer with latest Media3-Compose components

New Features

- Encrypted media streaming architecture (EncryptedMediaSource, streaming video groundwork)
- Image rotation action
- Image lock mode (prevent scrolling/swiping)
- Sidecar metadata caching + scheduled cleanup
- Adaptive decrypt threshold
- Workers progress screen
- Byte‑level aggregated copy progress
- Audio focus user preference
- Metrics instrumentation (internal) [removed logging claims]
- Unified deletion handoff via worker output
- Updated & merged translations

Bug Fixes

- Fixed Vault not encrypting or decrypting correctly
- Premature deletion during encrypt/hide eliminated
- ENOENT playback errors removed (no empty Uri before decrypt ready)
- Play/pause icon desync after paused seek fixed
- Large redundant decrypted byte[] allocations avoided
- FileNotFoundException from missing MediaStore items prevented
- Audio focus OFF no longer pauses external audio apps
- Playback position preserved across orientation changes
- UI stall on large encrypted video start reduced (async decrypt)
- Duplicate decrypts on rapid scroll prevented (single‑flight)
- Copy worker progress no longer jumps instantly or appears frozen
