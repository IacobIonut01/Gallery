/**
 * Snapshot of the panorama viewer's camera state, emitted via
 * [PanoramaViewer]'s `onCameraChanged` callback.
 *
 * This data class is intended for building overlay UI such as a compass indicator
 * or debugging HUD. All angles are in degrees.
 *
 * @property yaw Horizontal rotation in degrees.
 *   - [ProjectionType.SPHERE]: wraps freely around 360°.
 *   - [ProjectionType.CYLINDER]: clamped to the image arc boundaries.
 * @property pitch Vertical rotation in degrees.
 *   Positive values look up, negative values look down.
 *   Clamped to ±90° for spheres, ±45° for cylinders.
 * @property fov Current vertical field of view in degrees (zoomed via pinch gesture).
 *   Range: 30°–110°.
 * @property horizontalFov The effective horizontal field of view in degrees, derived
 *   from [fov] and the current viewport aspect ratio. Reflects the actual visible
 *   horizontal span and updates when the device rotates between portrait and landscape.
 * @property arcDegrees The horizontal angular span of the panorama geometry.
 *   360° for full spheres and full-wrap cylinders; less for partial panoramas.
 * @property projectionType The active projection mode.
 *
 * @see PanoramaViewer
