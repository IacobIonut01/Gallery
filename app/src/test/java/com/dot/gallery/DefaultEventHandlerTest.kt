/**
 * Regression tests for [DefaultEventHandler].
 *
 * See bug #918: the back gesture was ignored on videos when controls were hidden.
 * The media viewer's back handler pushes a [UIEvent.NavigationUpEvent] through the
 * event handler. The handler previously used a zero-capacity (rendezvous) channel,
 * whose `trySend` only succeeds when a receiver is suspended at that exact moment.
 * During video playback the main thread is busy with constant recomposition, so the
 * collector was frequently not waiting and the navigation event was silently dropped.
 *
 * The channel is now an unlimited buffer, so events queued before/while no receiver
 * is suspended are still delivered.
